## Inspiration
Before the hackathon began, I spent time brainstorming ideas that would help me grow as a developer. Up to this point, my experience had primarily been in backend development, using C++, Python, Java and some SQL.  One of my close friends challenged me to focus primarily on frontend development, which I was surprised by. So I held them up to their offer, and decide to just focus on creating a website with some beautiful UI 
## What it does
TaskSync & SecureNotes (As the Name states) is a small website where you submit your notes and tasks and they are uploaded into a database as storage. Everyone who is logged in (With Auth0) can see your Tasks and Notes (TaskSync) and It's primarily secure because those notes are not stored in the typical fashion in a website, rather using MongoDB
## How we built it
Since I had little experience with frontend development, I started by watching multiple tutorials to familiarize myself with the concepts and best practices. As for some of the backhand, I decided to also learn about JS with them and helped them link the webite with MongoDB first. After that was done, A login/logout feature was made, and there was a bunch of UI changes we made in the meanwhile. Initially, we had decided on going with a bright purple/white layout but ultimatly decided to go with a gold/black one because it seemed sleek.  
## Challenges we ran into
Our team had diverse skill sets—my teammates were more experienced in frontend development, while I specialized in backend development. I taught them how to connect and configue mongodb, while they taught me the absolute basics in html and js. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of my proudest achievements in this project is the UI design. After dedicating hours to refining the buttons, color schemes, animations, and transitions—such as fade-in and fade-out effects—I can confidently say that this is one of the best projects I have developed throughout high school and college.
## What we learned
Throughout this experience, my team and I gained valuable insights into both frontend and backend development. Personally, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed frontend development and plan to continue improving my UI skills. Meanwhile, I introduced my teammates on how to configure Netlify at a beginner level to help them contribute to the application's functionality. Additionally, I learned to integrate Auth0, while also teaching my teammates how to use MongoDB efficiently.

## What's next for TaskSync & Secure Notes
Looking ahead, I plan to incorporate AI features using an API that assist users while reviewing their notes, creating a more seamless and user-friendly experience without requiring them to switch tabs to gpt/deepseek. Additionally, adding a private section for personal notes would enhance the platform’s usability and security.
